## Development
#### 1. Run databases and services
```sh
$ docker compose up
```
#### 2. Run setup script
```sh
# will install depedencies and create .env file
$ npm run setup
```

#### 3. Run applications (api, worker and frontend web app)
```sh
$ npm run serve
```
#### 4. Forward Stripe webhook locally
```sh
$ stripe login # only once - stripe will remember your session
$ stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/api/stripe/webhook
```
> Stripe CLI will give you webhook signing secret like `whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`. Save this value in .env as **STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET** and restart API. CLI gives you the same secret so no need to repeat this step every time you run listen command.
